# SolarFold: Physics-Informed Shadow Estimation
**Research Sandbox**: This repo contains experimental code for a physics-constrained U-Net that predicts shadows from aerial imagery using differentiable ray-casting.
**File:** `solar-fold.ipynb` contains the model architecture and physics loss function along with outputs.
